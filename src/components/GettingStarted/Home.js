        <h2>What is Graphic Design?</h2>

        <p>
          Graphic design is not drawing, not painting, not creating a poster or
          a quick logo on your computer.
        </p>

        <p>
          These things are the means to the end and are skills in their own
          right.<br />
          Graphic design is not about making things look pretty,
        </p>

        <p>
          Graphic design is the organisation and presentation of information,
          developed through a creative process for a particular function.
        </p>

        <p>
          In graphic design we must first understand information, a message or a
          brief<br />
          and then research, think, imagine and develop and create a solution, a
          concept in order to communicate that information, tell a story, a
          message or idea in a visual way.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's only once we have a solid idea developed through the design
          process we can use our skills with layout, colour, typography and
          creative tools to bring that idea to life
        </p>
